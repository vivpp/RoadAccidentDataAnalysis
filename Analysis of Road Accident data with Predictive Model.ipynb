    "The Department of Transport reported in the year ending September 2017 that 27,010 people were either killed or seriously injured in reported road accidents and in quarter three of 2017 alone, 1720 people died as a result of road accidents. \n",

Previous research has explored specific areas of road accident data including clustering analysis such as Anderson(2009) or have explored road traffic accidents in an international setting (Abdel-Aty & Radwan 2000), but there is limited research that attemtps to offer practical solutions or direction for professionals or emergency services to reduce road accident casualties.\n",

    "My goal is to analyse data for UK road accidents from the period of 2005-2007 and 2012-2014 to offer some insight into road accident trends whilst attempting to offer solutions for emergency services that could be helpful in reducing accident casualties. This is attempted by identifying potential key causal factors that contribute to the occurrence of a road accident event. Additionally, I  attempt to generate a predictive model from this data as a complementary approach.\n",

The data for 2005-2007 and 2012-2014 was chosen to be analysed to enable some form of temporal analysis alongside spatial analysis, as a result of limited computer power that would have problems processing all 1.6million rows of the dataset.

    "The first decision I took was to gauge the general trend of road accidents for the two periods of time between 2005-2007 and 2012-2014 as shown by Fig1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 2005-2007 there is a gradual decline in accidents from just over 260,000 in 2005 to just under 250,000 in 2007. As a result, on average between 2005 and 2007, total road incidents per year equated to 250,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Between 2012-2014 road accidents were much lower with 2012 indicating 150,000 total road accidents. This year in particular was the lowest of the six years presented. However, I do see a gradual increase in road accidents in 2013 and 2014, with 2014 ending just under 200,000 in total road accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference in road accidents are shown between 2007 and 2012 with a decline of roughly 100,000 road accidents between 2007 and 2012, suggesting average decline in road accidents of 20,000 per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure does appear to be quite a substantial decline per year and one could argue that it is unrealistic. For example, if I compare this figure to the 2017 report by the Department of transport, I find that the published report indicated that total incidents for 2017 had fallen to 174,510 which was only a 5% decline from 2016. Taking this as a benchmark for average yearly decline as calculated by the Department of transport, numerically this 5% decline in accidents represents, roughly, a fall of 9184 which is almost double the amount suggested by the above bar chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I cannot suggest with certainty that an average decline of 20,000 road accidents per year is an accurate and reliable reflection of the change that occurred between 2007 and 2012. What is certain however, is that road accidents overtime have appeared to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this mind it is important to understand the potential factors that may have caused this general decline and other insights that this data can provide.\n",

On the other hand, both fatal and serious rank accidents, for these two periods cumulatively totalled 200,000 casualties. From Fig3 the only inference I can make is that minor accidents seem to occur substantially more frequently than Fatal or Serious accidents. Let's see if the severity of an accident could be related to the location of the incident itself."

    "Fig4-6 are scatterplots that identify the location of incidents based on their recorded accident severity ranking specifically for 2005. The charts seem to identify clusters for accidents particularly in the south east region of the UK and parts of the West Midlands. Such clusters are likely to form in these areas of the UK as they represent developed urban areas where a large percentage of population choose to live and work. Those who live outside these areas will often travel to such regions for work as well. Therefore, it is not surprising that clusters of accidents would form in developed urban areas such as the west midlands and south east regardless of the severity ranking of the recorded road accidents. Additionally, the cluster locations appear to remain the same when we map road accidents based on accident severity ranking. "

    "Over time we find the similar cluster patterns are followed in 2012 as they were in 2005 as illustrated in Fig7-9. One key difference between the 2005 and 2012 scatterplots are shown by fatal accidents. In 2005 accident clusters appear to be more prominent whereas in 2012 they appear to be more dispersed across the UK. In 2012 particularly, the cluster map for fatal accidents displays a more widely dispersed and even illustration of fatal accidents occurrences across the UK. Additionally, 2012 serious and slight accident severity rankings show their clusters to be less prominent than those in 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we can discern that the location of an incident does not necessarily affect the severity ranking associated with said incident. Consequently, if severity of accidents is not influenced by geographical data, then this suggest that there are other factors need to be considered when determining causal factors of road accidents."

    "When I introduce number of casualties to the mix I find that this supports the inverse relationship between adverse weather conditions and accident severity. Fig11 illustrates significantly larger number of casualties for weather conditions such Fine without high winds + Slight severity accidents with a count of 400 casualties. Yet when I look at the same severity ranking but for the Raining with high winds casualties are equate to less than 50. An explanation for this inverse relationship could be due to the type of climate that the UK experiences. Through my own personal experience, snow weather conditions are far less frequent than rain or fine weather conditions, so naturally the occurrence of accidents during snow weather conditions are likely to be smaller.  \n",

Correlation matrices work by determining the correlation coefficients of all variables with one another including itself. The correlation coefficients are values between -1 and 1 produced for each relationship with values of 1 signifying either a perfect positive or negative relationship. The code below is the correlation matrix for the c0514 dataset."

    "Now that I have visualised the strength of relationships between each variable, I ideally want to look at the number of casualties and its relationship with other variables. Looking at the correlation plot I can see that most variables have a very weak relationship with Number of Casualties as correlation coefficients  appear to lie between -0.25 and 0. The two variables that do appear have an impact are accident severity and number of vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing number of casualties with accident severity, I find that there is a weak negative correlation equivalent to -0.093606. This suggests that as the number of casualties increase the rating associated with the severity of an accident decreases by 0.093606 and vice versa. This supports previous analysis conducted and illustrated by Fig11. \n",
    "The second relationship between number of casualties and number of vehicles is far stronger with a correlation coefficient of 0.234. This suggests as number of casualties increase the number vehicles involved in an accident will also increase and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis though simple could be useful for helping emergency services to develop an understanding of road accident factors, as correlation matrices help establish statistical relationships between variables providing potential direction to focus research."

    "Another manner in which analysis of data could help accident services is through predictive modelling. Predictive modelling enables forecasting of a target variable. This is achieved by defining a variety of predictor variables that are likely to influence the results of the target variable, collecting data for these predictors, and applying an algorithm to the data and predictor variables to generate a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm I will be applying is the Random Forest Classifier. I chose to implement the Random Forest Classifier as it is widely accepted, effective and accurate method of creating models using categorical data(Fawagreh et al, 2014). The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble method of predictive modelling. In essence, where a  singular decision tree algorithm will only create one decision tree an ensemble method, or Random Forest Classifier in this case, will generate multiple decision trees before determining an average prediction value. Note though, ensemble methods are not limited to generating to multiple decision trees and can generate other models. Ensemble models are very beneficial because they attempt to minimise problems of overfitting data. Overfitting is a big problem as can be thought of as the predictive model being unable to predict accurate outcomes on unseen data, that is the model is likely to generate inaccurate results when new data introduced. Random Forest Classifier overcomes this issue as more decision tree are generated, known as the strong law of large numbers (Pal, 2005).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As per the subtitle I will be attempting to generate a predictive model on Police attendance at a road accident site. Prior to deciding on generating this specific model I had attempted to implement predictive models on other variables, such as accident severity, in this dataset, but came across a crucial problem of the Random Forest Classifier. The key issue is that the Random Forest Classifier is best suited to dealing with binary problems, that is problems where target variables have at maximum to value types or class types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data in this dataset have multiple class types and therefore implementation of a standard Random Forest Classifier would not be possible. That said I do believe there is some value in generating this model. Though it may not directly aid in reducing casualty numbers from road accidents, modelling prediction of police attendance at accident sites may provide some use in improving quality of emergency services as police attendance at accident site should always occur. Thus, predicting police attendance given certain accident features could prove useful to improve resource allocation."

    "Throughout this process of analysis the main insight from the data appears to suggest that environmental factors such as weather conditions have a weak inverse relationship to the number of casualties recorded at accident sites. The graphs created illustrate that casualties are most recorded during fine weather conditions compared to weather such as rain or even fog and mist. Similarly, most accidents recorded are categorised as a 'slight' severity compared to 'fatal' or 'serious'. Yet, regardless of accident severity, geographically accidents tend to occur in clusters in roughly the same regions. Naturally, I would think that better weather conditions should lead to less recorded casualties from road incidents, but this does not appear to be the case. Yet we cannot say with certainty what the root cause to this insight is. As a result, its application to emergency services units are limited but does provide a good starting point into further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better interpretations could be made by pairing this data with driver data related to these incidents. Driver data could have a large influence in analysis and predictive modelling of road accidents and may provide some insight where data on environmental factors have not been able to. Referring back to Fig11, I saw that fine road conditions seemed to cause a greater number of casualties than weather conditions such as rain or even snow and though these weather conditions occur less frequently one would expect casualties from more dangerous weather conditions to lead to more casualties. That said we do not have enough data to confirm or disprove this statement. This is where I believe additional data such as driver information could provide some further insight to explain these unusual observations from which true benefits to emergency services can be generated and utilised to its fullest.\n"
